        <p>"Da Big Phat" lifestyle is a new dawn, a new pair of eyes. There are no 'rules' but as everyone knows, some things that give instant gratification just don't belong in your life.
            The way to go as we see it is phat beats, fat food... & vegetables. That is our tagline at least, but there are some more things in this. Keep browsing if you're interested.

            We gon' make music on such awesome things such as Cubase, the Roland SP404 and more. We're gonna collab with some people, even tho' that has been made 
            about a 100 times more difficult with this pandemic going on. We gon' make fat food on the grill and bbq up some veggies to go with it. We gon' exert ourselves physically 
            as much as we feel creates a happier us.
            We gon' meditate, read, listen to the silence and connect as much as we can. We also gon' sleep enough so the brain can process and the body can rest.
            Respect the sabbath.
